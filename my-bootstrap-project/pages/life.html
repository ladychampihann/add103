        <p>Welcome to Life with Cooper, where you‚Äôll get a peek into his daily adventures and see what makes him so special. Every morning with Cooper starts with a bit of negotiation. Before he‚Äôll even think about going outside, he demands belly rubs‚Äîa rule he never breaks! Once he‚Äôs satisfied, he heads out to do his business, and then we take a walk around the neighborhood. After his walk, it‚Äôs breakfast time, but Cooper isn‚Äôt done until he presses his ‚Äútreat‚Äù button, making it clear he‚Äôs ready for dessert. His funny routines always bring a smile to our faces.</p>
        <h3>Habits</h3>
        <p>Cooper has his own quirky habits that make life interesting. After coming inside, he runs straight to the couch, which he treats like his personal throne. He loves pulling out his unicorn toys for a round of play, and if you‚Äôre ever missing a sock, chances are Cooper has ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù it and hidden it somewhere. He‚Äôs also a big fan of puzzle toys, showing off his smarts by solving them in creative ways‚Äîsometimes even tossing them down the stairs to speed things up. His antics never fail to entertain us!</p>
        <h3>Cuddle Companion</h3>
        <p>At the end of the day, Cooper turns into a cuddle-loving companion. He insists on ‚ÄúCooper time‚Äù every night, snuggling up for a special moment before settling at my feet to sleep. From his playful personality to his loving rituals, Cooper fills every day with laughter, warmth, and joy. Life with Cooper is never dull, and we wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way!</p>
        <h3>Charlie:</h3>
          <p>Well, if you were directly above him, how could you see him?</p>
