        <h3 class="mt-4">What makes him so Special</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Life with Cooper, where you’ll get a peek into his daily adventures and see what makes him so special. Every morning with Cooper starts with a bit of negotiation. Before he’ll even think about going outside, he demands belly rubs—a rule he never breaks! Once he’s satisfied, he heads out to do his business, and then we take a walk around the neighborhood. After his walk, it’s breakfast time, but Cooper isn’t done until he presses his “treat” button, making it clear he’s ready for dessert. His funny routines always bring a smile to our faces.</p>
        <h3>Habits</h3>
        <p>Cooper has his own quirky habits that make life interesting. After coming inside, he runs straight to the couch, which he treats like his personal throne. He loves pulling out his unicorn toys for a round of play, and if you’re ever missing a sock, chances are Cooper has “borrowed” it and hidden it somewhere. He’s also a big fan of puzzle toys, showing off his smarts by solving them in creative ways—sometimes even tossing them down the stairs to speed things up. His antics never fail to entertain us!</p>
        <h3>Cuddle Companion</h3>
        <p>At the end of the day, Cooper turns into a cuddle-loving companion. He insists on “Cooper time” every night, snuggling up for a special moment before settling at my feet to sleep. From his playful personality to his loving rituals, Cooper fills every day with laughter, warmth, and joy. Life with Cooper is never dull, and we wouldn’t have it any other way!</p>
        <h3>Charlie:</h3>
          <p>Well, if you were directly above him, how could you see him?</p>
